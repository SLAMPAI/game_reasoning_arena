🧠 Reasoning: As the game starts, the goal is to control the center of the board.

By placing my X in the center, I can potentially create two possible winning lines and force my opponent to respond to my central presence.

🧠 Reasoning: In the initial state of the game, I will choose a corner to maximize my chances of winning. This is because if I place my X in a corner, I have two possible ways to win in the next move, depending on where my opponent places their O. Additionally, placing in a corner gives me more control over the center of the board, which is a crucial area in tic-tac-toe.

🧠 Reasoning: To win the game, I need to place my next "X" in a position that will give me a chance to win in the next move. Looking at the board, the top-right corner is empty, and if I place my next "X" there, I will have the opportunity to win in the next move. However, since the available actions are 4, 6, and 8, I will choose action 8, which is the top-right corner, as it is the best available option.

Placing my next "x" in the middle row will give me a chance to win or at least create a draw. The available actions are 3, 6, and 8. Action 3 is in the middle row, which aligns with my strategy.

🎯 Action: 6
🧠 Reasoning: The current state of the board shows that the opponent (O) has two possible winning combinations. To block their winning chances, I need to place my X in a position that will prevent them from winning. The available actions are 3, 6, and 8. Action 3 will block the top-left winning combination, action 6 will block the middle-left winning combination, and action 8 will block the bottom-left winning combination. Since the middle-left winning combination is the most likely to happen, I will choose action 6 to block it.
