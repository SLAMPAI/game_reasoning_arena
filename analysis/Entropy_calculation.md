# üìä Reasoning Entropy Analysis Report

## üî¨ What is Reasoning Entropy?

**Entropy** in this context measures the **diversity** of reasoning types used by an AI agent during gameplay. It quantifies how varied or predictable an agent's reasoning patterns are.

**Entropy measures reasoning DIVERSITY and ADAPTATION**. It reveals how flexible and context-aware an AI agent's strategic thinking is. The entropy graphs show whether agents are rigid rule-followers or adaptive strategists, providing crucial insights into the sophistication of their reasoning processes.

Higher entropy indicates more sophisticated reasoning **when it appears at appropriate times**, but the pattern and timing of entropy changes is more important than the absolute values.


## üìê Mathematical Formula

```
H = -Œ£(p_i * log2(p_i))
```

Where:
- `H` = Entropy in bits
- `p_i` = Proportion of reasoning type i
- `Œ£` = Sum over all reasoning types

## üî¨ Entropy Methodology Calculation

The entropy calculation in this system operates at **three distinct levels**, each providing different insights:

### **Level 1: Per Model, Per Game, Across Episodes (Turn-wise)**

**What it calculates:** `entropy_trend_[agent]_[game].png`

```python
# Groups by: (agent_name, game_name), then by turn
for (agent, game), df_group in self.df.groupby(["agent_name", "game_name"]):
    entropy_by_turn = df_group.groupby("turn")["reasoning_type"]
```

**Aggregation:**
- **Scope**: One specific model (e.g., GPT-4) playing one specific game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe)
- **Across**: All episodes of that game played by that model
- **Grouping**: By turn position (Turn 1, Turn 2, Turn 3, etc.)

**Example**: GPT-4 played 10 episodes of Tic-Tac-Toe:
- **Turn 1 Entropy**: Reasoning types from Turn 1 across all 10 episodes ‚Üí Calculate H‚ÇÅ
- **Turn 2 Entropy**: Reasoning types from Turn 2 across all 10 episodes ‚Üí Calculate H‚ÇÇ
- **Turn 3 Entropy**: Reasoning types from Turn 3 across all 10 episodes ‚Üí Calculate H‚ÇÉ

**Purpose**: Shows how one specific model's reasoning diversity evolves during a specific game type.

### **Level 2: Across All Models, Per Game, Across Episodes (Turn-wise)**

**What it calculates:** `entropy_by_turn_all_agents_[game].png`

```python
# Groups by: game_name, then by agent_name, then by turn
for game, df_game in self.df.groupby("game_name"):
    for agent, df_agent in df_game.groupby("agent_name"):
        entropy_by_turn = df_agent.groupby("turn")["reasoning_type"]
```

**Aggregation:**
- **Scope**: All models playing one specific game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe)
- **Across**: All episodes of that game played by each model
- **Grouping**: By turn position for each model separately, then plotted together

**Purpose**: Compare how different models adapt their reasoning during the same game type.

### **Level 3: Across All Models, Across All Games (Turn-wise)**

**What it calculates:** `avg_entropy_all_games.png`

```python
# Groups by: turn only (all agents, all games combined)
df_all = self.df[~self.df['agent_name'].str.startswith("random")]
avg_entropy = df_all.groupby("turn")["reasoning_type"]
```

**Aggregation:**
- **Scope**: ALL models playing ALL games
- **Across**: Every episode, every game, every model
- **Grouping**: By turn position only (mega-pool of all reasoning types)

**Example**:
- **Turn 1**: Combines reasoning types from Turn 1 of ALL episodes of ALL games from ALL models
- **Turn 2**: Combines reasoning types from Turn 2 of ALL episodes of ALL games from ALL models

**Purpose**: Shows global reasoning diversity trends across the entire dataset.

### **4. Key Insights from Multi-Level Analysis**

#### **Level 1 Insights: Individual Model Behavior**
- **Model-specific adaptation patterns**: Does GPT-4 start broad and focus? Does Llama stay consistent?
- **Game-specific strategies**: How does the same model behave differently in Chess vs. Tic-Tac-Toe?
- **Learning curves**: Does the model's reasoning evolve predictably within game types?

#### **Level 2 Insights: Model Comparisons**
- **Relative adaptability**: Which models show more strategic flexibility during the same game?
- **Convergent vs. divergent behavior**: Do all models follow similar reasoning patterns or are they distinct?
- **Performance correlation**: Do models with better entropy patterns also win more games?

#### **Level 3 Insights: Global Patterns**
- **Universal reasoning trends**: Are there fundamental patterns of how AI reasoning should evolve during gameplay?
- **Cross-game consistency**: Do optimal reasoning patterns transfer across different game types?
- **Aggregate intelligence**: What does the "collective AI reasoning landscape" look like?

### **5. Scientific Value of This Multi-Level Methodology**

#### **Statistical Robustness**
- **Reduces noise**: Single-game analysis can be misleading due to random factors
- **Increases sample size**: Multiple episodes provide statistically significant data
- **Captures consistency**: Shows whether reasoning patterns are reproducible across games

#### **Strategic Insights**
The entropy values represent:

- **Turn-wise reasoning diversity** averaged across all games played
- **Strategic adaptation patterns** showing if an LLM becomes more/less diverse over the course of typical gameplay
- **Model comparison capability** since all models are evaluated on the same aggregation basis

#### **Research Sophistication**
This approach is **comprehensive** because it reveals whether LLMs have **consistent reasoning patterns at specific game phases** (early, mid, late game) across multiple game instances, rather than just looking at a single game which could be noisy or atypical.

#### **Practical Applications**
- **Model Development**: Identify which models show better strategic adaptation
- **Training Insights**: Understand how reasoning diversity should evolve during gameplay
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Quantify the "intelligence" and "adaptability" of reasoning beyond simple accuracy metrics
- **Phase-Specific Analysis**: Understand optimal reasoning patterns for different game phases

## üéØ How to Interpret Entropy Values

### ‚úÖ HIGH ENTROPY (>1.0 bits) Indicates:
- **Strategic flexibility** and adaptation
- **Context-aware reasoning**
- **Sophisticated decision-making**
- **Good generalization** across game states

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW ENTROPY (<0.5 bits) Indicates:

- **Predictable behavior**
- Could mean: **poor reasoning quality** OR **highly focused strategy**

### üîÑ ENTROPY TREND PATTERNS:

| Pattern | Meaning | Quality |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **üìà Increasing** | Agent learns and adapts during game | Usually Good |
| **üìâ Decreasing** | Agent converges to specific strategies | Context-dependent |
| **üîÑ Fluctuating** | Agent responds dynamically to game state | Usually Good |
| **‚ûñ Flat High** | Consistent high-quality diverse reasoning | Good |
| **‚ûñ Flat Low** | Consistent single-strategy (good or bad) | Context-dependent |

## üéÆ Game-Specific Entropy Insights

### Early Game (First few turns)
