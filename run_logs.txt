2025-08-30 14:11:58,291 - simulate - INFO - Agent 0 (litellm_groq/llama3-8b-8192) chose action: 4 with reasoning: I choose to place my X in the center of the board, which is the most strategic position. This allows me to have the most options for my next move and puts pressure on my opponent to respond. Additionally, placing my X in the center gives me the best chance to win the game by creating a potential row, column, or diagonal.

Since the opponent has already placed their O in the top-left corner, I will place my X in the center of the board to put pressure on their position and limit their options. This will also give me the opportunity to potentially create a winning line in the future.

By playing in cell 3, I can block the potential win for O and also set up a potential win for myself. Additionally, playing in cell 3 will give me more options for my next move.
